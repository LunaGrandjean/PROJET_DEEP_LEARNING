# Deep Learning Project: Marine Species Identification

### Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the identification of marine species present at specific locations. The project is conducted in collaboration with an environmental conservation association. The dataset consists of images of several marine species, annotated with bounding boxes.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available for download here: https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/fish. It includes images of various marine species classified by their Latin names. The images are annotated with bounding boxes, facilitating object detection tasks.
